#Write a function named getCostOfCoffee() that has a parameters named
#numberOfCoffees and pricePerCoffee. Given this information, the function returns the total
#cost of the coffee order. This is not a simple multiplication of cost and quantity, however, because the
#coffee shop has an offer where you get one free coffee for every eight coffees you buy.
#For example, buying eight coffees for $2.50 each costs $20 (or 8 Ã— 2.5). But buying nine coffees
#also costs $20, since the first eight makes the ninth coffee free. Buying ten coffees calculates as
#follows: $20 for the first eight coffees, a free ninth coffee, and $2.50 for the tenth coffee for a total of
#$22.50.

#FINISHED
def getCostOfCoffee(numberOfCoffees, pricePerCoffee):
    mult = numberOfCoffees * pricePerCoffee

    return final

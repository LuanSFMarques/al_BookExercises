#It takes about 365.25 days for the earth to revolve around the sun. This slight offset would cause
our 365-day calendar to become inaccurate over time. Therefore, leap years have an extra day,
#February 29th. A leap year occurs on all years divisible by four (e.g., 2016, 2020, 2024, and so on).
#However, the exception to this rule is that years divisible by one hundred (e.g., 2100, 2200, 2300, and
#so on) arenâ€™t leap years. And the exception to this exception is that years divisible by four hundred
#(e.g., 2000, 2400, and so on) are leap years.
#Exercise Description
#Write a isLeapYear() function with an integer year parameter. If year is a leap year, the
#function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

#FINISHED
